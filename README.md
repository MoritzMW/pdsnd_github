### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, we make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  
We learn about bike share use in these cities by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. The following information is provided:
* Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip duration
* User info (i.e. counts of each user type, etc.)
